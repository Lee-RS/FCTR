# FCTR

This repo relased the code of FCTR for RSI semantic segmentation. 

FCTR can be plug-and-play module, enhancing transformer-like baselines, such as Segformer, Segmenter, Swin Transformer, SwinUNet, AAformer, CLCFormer and so forth. 

Other comparative models and parameters will be uplaoded via Google Drive. The experiments are conducted on ISPRS Potsdam and LoveDA datasets, repectively, with official defaults.
